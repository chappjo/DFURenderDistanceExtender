# DFURenderDistanceExtender
Simple Daggerfall Unity mod to override render distance to higher values than default.

This was built for an older version of Daggerfall Unity, so I don't know if it still works with the latest version.

To install, just download the zip, and put the dfmod into you mods folder.
